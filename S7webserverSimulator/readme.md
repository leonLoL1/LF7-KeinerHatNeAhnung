### Simulation of the web server on a Siemens S7 PLC
The website can be developed on the local computer. This means that the development process is not interrupted by constant, laborious and time-consuming uploads. \
Here the web server is in the foreground and the user logic of the PLC program is integrated. This is a simple contactor control with latching.
You need to customize the user logic according to your needs. \
(I am aware that, for the sake of simplicity, the flexibility here is severely limited and reality is only inadequately represented).
